We will solve this on the domain $0\\le x\\le 1$ and we will assume periodic boundary conditions. The first thing we need to do is set up a discretisation, or mesh, of this domain. We do this using one of the inbuilt Firedrake meshes. The input to this function is simply the number of cells in the domain, here 20:"
